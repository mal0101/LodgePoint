## Learnings:

- The gap property in css sets a gap between rows and columns to the specified unit.

- The overflow property in css specifies what should happen if content overflows an element's box.

- The CSS repeat() function is used to repeat a set of columns or rows in a grid.

- This function is useful if you have a large number of rows or columns in a grid. With this function you create a "repeat-pattern" to be used.

- The <aside> tag defines some content aside from the content it is placed in.

The aside content should be indirectly related to the surrounding content.
